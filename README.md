# Coding challenges
Welcome to my Coding Practice Playground! This GitHub repository is a collection of solutions and code samples from various coding platforms, including LeetCode and other popular coding challenge websites. As a passionate coder and lifelong learner, I've created this repository to share my journey of mastering algorithms and data structures, and I'm excited to have you join me on this coding adventure.

## What will you find in here?
This is a repository that contains coding tests that I have curated from a collection of problems that cover a wide spectrum of difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced while I was at college and sicne then. This practice have helped me on skilling up as a programmer.

## The challenges
Each challenge is hosted in a different directory. You will find in each directory:
1. the problem description.
2. The challenge's difficulty.
3. Test cases to validate the solution.

> May your code be efficient, your algorithms be elegant, and your solutions be stellar! ðŸŒŸ

Happy coding!
